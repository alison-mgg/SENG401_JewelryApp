    "description": "- What material is the bracelet made of?\n  That's a lovely bracelet!  The image shows a gold-toned bracelet with clear stones.  However, the *material* isn't specified in the image.  It could be:\n\n* **Gold-plated:** This is a common and affordable option.  A base metal (like brass or sterling silver) is coated with a thin layer of gold.\n* **Sterling Silver:**  A higher-quality option, but might be rhodium-plated to give it a brighter, more durable gold-like finish.\n* **Solid Gold:** This would be the most expensive option.  It would be made entirely of gold.\n\nTo know for certain, you'd need to check the product description where you found the image or the accompanying information that came with the bracelet itself (if you own it).  Look for terms like \"14k gold,\" \"18k gold,\" \"gold-plated,\" \"sterling silver,\" or similar.\n\n- Does it have any charms or special attachments?\n  That's a pretty bracelet!  It has small cubic zirconia stones (simulated diamonds) as its main charms.  The chain itself also has small beads, which could be considered a decorative element, but the stones are the main \"charms\" or decorative attachments.\n\n- Is the bracelet rigid (bangle) or flexible (chain, cord)?\n  That's a flexible bracelet.  It's a chain or cord style, not a rigid bangle.\n",
