    "description": "- What material is the bracelet made of?\n  That's a lovely bracelet!  The image shows a gold-toned bracelet.  However, the image alone doesn't definitively state the *material*. It could be:\n\n* **Gold-plated:**  This is a common and more affordable option.  A base metal (like brass or sterling silver) is coated with a thin layer of gold.\n* **Solid Gold:**  This would be more expensive and durable.  The karat (e.g., 14k, 18k) would specify the gold's purity.\n* **Gold-filled:** A thicker layer of gold bonded to a base metal, more durable than plating but less so than solid gold.\n\nTo know for sure what material the bracelet is made of, you'd need to check the product description where it was purchased or look for any hallmarks on the clasp or chain itself.\n\n- Does it have any charms or special attachments?\n  That's a pretty bracelet!  It has small, clear cubic zirconia stones set in square bezels as its main charms.  There are also tiny gold beads interspersed along the chain.  Besides those, there aren't any additional dangling charms or significant attachments.\n\n- Is the bracelet rigid (bangle) or flexible (chain, cord)?\n  That's a flexible bracelet.  It's a chain bracelet with small beads and larger cubic zirconia stones.  It's not a rigid bangle.\n",
