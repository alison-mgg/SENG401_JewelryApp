It's difficult to be completely certain from the image alone.\n\n* **Type of chain:** The chains are all **rope chains**.  Specifically, they appear to be a type of twisted or braided rope chain, sometimes called a \"diamond-cut rope\" chain due to the facets that catch the light.\n\n* **Type or style of necklace:** This is a layered necklace, featuring three different lengths of rope chain.  It's a simple, delicate style.\n\n* **Type of pendant:** There are no pendants on the necklace shown.\n\n* **Necklace length:** The longest chain falls into the **loose fit** category, likely a **princes**s length  or possibly a **matinee** length depending on the exact measurement.  The shorter chains are clearly shorter than princess length.\n",
