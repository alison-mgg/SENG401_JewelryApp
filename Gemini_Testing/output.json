    "description": "- What material is the bracelet made of?\n  That's a lovely bracelet!  The image shows a gold-toned bracelet.  However, the image doesn't specify *what* kind of gold (e.g., 14k, 18k, gold-filled, gold-plated) or if it is another metal with gold plating.  The stones appear to be cubic zirconia.\n\nTo know for sure what material the bracelet is made of, you would need to check the product description where you found the image.\n\n- Does it have any charms or special attachments?\n  That's a pretty bracelet!  It has small, clear cubic zirconia stones set in what appear to be square or cushion-cut settings.  These are the main \"charms\" or decorative elements.  There are also small beads interspersed between the larger stones along the chain.  Beyond those, it doesn't have any additional charms or pendants hanging from it.\n\n- Is the bracelet rigid (bangle) or flexible (chain, cord)?\n  That's a flexible bracelet.  It's a chain-style bracelet, not a rigid bangle.\n",
