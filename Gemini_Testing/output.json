    "description": "- What material is the bracelet made of?\n  That's a lovely bracelet!  The image shows a gold-toned bracelet.  However, the image doesn't specify *what kind* of gold (10k, 14k, 18k, etc.) or if it's gold-plated over another metal (like sterling silver or brass).  The stones appear to be cubic zirconia.\n\nTo know for sure what material the bracelet is made of, you'd need to check the product description where you saw the image.\n\n- Does it have any charms or special attachments?\n  That's a pretty bracelet!  It has several charms or attachments:\n\n* **Cubic Zirconia Stones:** The most prominent are the four larger, square-cut cubic zirconia stones set along the chain.  These are the main decorative elements.\n\n* **Small Beads:**  Smaller beads are interspersed between the larger stones along the length of the chain.  These add detail and visual interest.\n\n* **Lobster Clasp:** The clasp itself could be considered a functional attachment.\n\nSo, while it doesn't have dangling charms, it does have the cubic zirconia stones and beads that function as decorative attachments.\n\n- Is the bracelet rigid (bangle) or flexible (chain, cord)?\n  That's a flexible bracelet.  It's a chain bracelet with small beads and larger stones.  It's not a rigid bangle.\n\n- If any, what is the visible brand logo?\n  That's a bracelet from **Zales**.  The small logo is visible on the clasp.\n",
