            "text": "The provided text only states the brand name is Glamira, but doesn't give a model number.  Therefore, I cannot provide a model number for the described ring, nor can I provide specific details on 5 similar products with pricing and model numbers without access to a product catalog or online retailer's database.  To find similar products, you would need to search online retailers using terms like \"halo diamond ring,\" \"pave diamond ring,\" \"yellow gold diamond ring,\" or \"modern vintage diamond ring.\"\n\nTherefore, I can only offer a template with placeholder data to illustrate the desired format:\n\n\n* **Brand Name A - Model Name X (Model Number: Unavailable) - $500-700**\n    *A yellow gold halo diamond ring with pave setting on the band, similar in style to the described Glamira ring. Features a smaller center diamond and slightly less intricate detailing.*\n\n* **Brand Name B - Model Name Y (Model Number: Unavailable) - $750-1000**\n    *Similar to the Glamira ring, this features a yellow gold band with a larger central diamond in a halo setting and pave diamonds on the band.  The design might be slightly more modern and less vintage-inspired.*\n\n* **Brand Name C - Model Name Z (Model Number: 12345) - $1000-1500**\n    *A luxury yellow gold ring featuring a substantial round brilliant-cut diamond in a halo setting, with a full pave band.  More luxurious materials and superior craftsmanship may contribute to the higher price point.*\n\n* **Brand Name D - Model Name AA (Model Number: Unavailable) - $1500-2000**\n    *High-end yellow gold ring with an exceptionally large and high-quality diamond in a halo setting. Includes intricate detailing on the band beyond a simple pave setting, elevating the design's complexity.*\n\n* **Brand Name E - Model Name BB (Model Number: 67890) - $2000-3000**\n    *Exceptional quality, featuring a large, high-clarity diamond.  The halo and pave settings are meticulously crafted, using potentially more diamonds than the other rings. The yellow gold is likely of higher karat.*\n\n\n**Remember that these are *example* entries only and do not represent actual products or prices.**  You must conduct your own online search to find comparable rings.\n"
